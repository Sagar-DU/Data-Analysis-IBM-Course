# Types of objects in Python
type (12)
# print (type(12)) # the output will be int

type (2.14)
# print (type(2.14)) # the output will be float

type ("Hello, world!")
# print (type("Hello, world!")) # the output will be str

# Converting from one object type to a different object type
type (2)
# print (type(2)) #will give me an int

# print (float(2)) #converted the int into float

# print (int (1.1)) # converted the float into int and rounded to the lower integer value

# print (int ("1")) # converted string 1 into int 1

# print (int ("1 or 2 people")) # can't convert this one and will give me an error

# print (float ("1.2")) # coverted into float

# print (str(1)) #converted into string

# print (type(str(1)))

# print (str(1.2)) # converted float into string

# print (type(str(1.2)))

# Boolean Data type 
# print (type(True))
# print (type(False)) #These are the two types of booleans

# print (int(True)) # will give me 1 as True
# print (float(False)) # will give me 0.0 as False

# Expressions and Variables 
# print (43 + 60 + 16 + 41) # will give me the sum
# print (50 - 60) # will give me substraction
# print (5 * 5) # will give me multiplication
# print (25/6) # will give me division and the result will always be in float
# print (26//6) # will give me integer division

# print (30 + 2 * 60) # will follow the mathematical rule
# print ((30 + 2) * 60) # will do the brackets first

# Variables
x = 43 + 60 + 16 + 41
# print (x) # will give me the sum

y = x / 60
# print (y) # can be use to define other variable in expression

x = x / 60
# print (x) # can change itself

# This all there is to in Lab 1!
